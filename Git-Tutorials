git diff

8. Comparing staging area and repository.

# Viewing changes in staging area which are not committed yet in repository.

git diff --staged


9. Deleting files.
=========================================

# Removing files from repository and working directory.

git rm <file_name>

# check status

git status

# Once the file is removed its advised to take a snapshot by following command.

git commit -m "Deleted <file_name>"


10. Move and rename files in git

========

git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>

# Move file in different folder.

git mv <file_name> <folder_name>/

# Move file in a different folder and rename it.

git mv <file_name> <folder_name>/<new_file_name>


11. Committing directly to repository.
=================================================

# Commit the changes without adding it in staging area.

git commit -am "Message"

Note :

1.This command will push all files in the repository even if u make changes in a single file.
So, Be aware of it.
2.Do not use this command if you are deleting or renaming or moving files in local repository.


12. Undo changes via git
===========================

# Undo changes from repository to working directory

git checkout -- <file_name>s


# Undo changes from staging area to working directory.

git reset HEAD <file_name>

NOTE:

The reset command (default) does not change the working directory.
Therefore, the working directory still contains unwanted comments.
We can use the checkout command from the previous example to remove unwanted changes from working directory.
